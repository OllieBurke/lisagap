This package was originally developed by Eleonora Castelli at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and adapted, packaged, and GPU-accelerated by Ollie Burke at the University of Glasgow.

The development of this software was supported by the LISA mission and the broader gravitational wave community's efforts to prepare for space-based gravitational wave detection.
